# My bachalor thesis 
# 3D animations in advertising on social media 
## Abstract
Firstly, I want to mention that I will be working on my bachelor's thesis and state exams next year. I extended my studies because of a 3-minute bachelor's film I have to make. You might think that making a 3-minute video is easy, but it's not. It's tough, especially when using all 3D animation like I am. 
## Introduction
For my thesis, I chose the topic of 3D animations on social media. I picked this because I love the world of 3D advertising. I like seeing 3D products in different settings, well-lit, and moving. I chose social media because I enjoy using it, and it's a good way to show these 3D ads to many people. 

In my film, I want to show something related to music. I'd like to create a 3D music video for an artist, with their permission. I love music; it inspires me a lot. I use music to express my feelings and turn them into 3D images. Before, I expressed my feelings through dance, but now I do it with 3D. 

## Why I Chose This Topic
In my film, I want to show something related to music. I'd like to create a 3D music video for an artist, with their permission. I love music; it inspires me a lot. I use music to express my feelings and turn them into 3D images. Before, I expressed my feelings through dance, but now I do it with 3D. 
So, that's the direction I want to take for my thesis. It might change a bit, but I know music will be a big part of it.
